"How is it that two programs each running on their own computer can "
"communicate with each other?  This is, of course, what happens many times"
" a day when your browser shows you a web page.  Your browser is a "
"program, and it must communicate with a web server in order to get the "
"HTML, CSS, images, and Javascript that make up a web page.  The details "
"of how this simple communication happens can take an entire semester in a"
" Networking course.  We are going to tackle just the top layer of this "
"problem looking at the application layer of the Networking stack."

"The building block of the application layer is the socket.  Sockets "
"provide for easy two way communication between two programs running on "
"two different computers (or hosts).  A socket is uniquely identified by "
"four values:"

"These values need some definition.  First, what do we mean by an IP "
"address?  You already know that the computers on the internet have nice "
"memorable names like www.google.com or knuth.luther.edu.  Each name can "
"be translated into a unique IP numerical IP address, such as "
"192.203.196.71, only 1 machine on the internet can have the IP address of"
" 192.203.196.71  (however, that address can be known by multiple names)."
"   The numerical addresses are necessary for the machinery of the "
"internet to do the work of getting a message from one machine to the "
"other."

"The port number is important because one computer may have many programs "
"running each corresponding to a different network service.  For example "
"the web server runs on port 80 while the mail server runs on port 25 and "
"the ssh server runs on port 22.  So the port identifies which program on "
"the computer the socket is connected to.  On your laptop, the situation "
"is similar, you may have a web browser connected to many different web "
"servers in differnt tabs, you have a mail client connected to a mail "
"server, and you probably have an message client connected to a chat "
"server, etc."
