"Some tags in HTML are designed for you to use in creating a logical "
"structure for your page.  As you have probably noticed many sites have a "
"navigation bar in the header, and have some information about the page in"
" a footer.  Many web pages have sidebars, and of course blogs and many "
"news sites are divided into articles.  Scholarly web sites are divided "
"into parts and sections."

"You have probably also noticed that it is pretty easy to tell the "
"different parts of a web page apart because they have a distinct look to "
"them.  In order to give different sections different looks we need to "
"provide some structure within our markup.   This is done by using "
"structural tags as follows:"
