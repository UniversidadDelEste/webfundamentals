"The number of times we do something is controlled by the three "
"statements: 1. ``i = 0`` this is our starting value 2. ``i < 10`` this is"
" our stopping condition.  We will keep doing whatever is inside the for "
"statement until ``i < 10`` is no longer true. 3.  ``i++`` this is really "
"important as it changes the value of i and allows us to make progress "
"towards the end.  Without this third component, i would never increase "
"and we would do whatever is inside the loop forever.  This is called an "
"**infinite loop**."
