"We have made excellent progress toward learning about Web Programming.  "
"You have learned something about two of the three primary web programming"
" languages.  We will continue to explore HTML and CSS in more detail, but"

"Javascript is a procedural language.  With HTML and especially CSS the "
"order of things is not always important, but with Javascript, the order "
"that you do things in is very important.  Javascript is also called an "
"**object oriented** language.  That means that we will be working with "
"objects in our imaginary world of the browser.  Objects can tell us "
"things we want to know, and objects know how to do many things.  We only "
"need to write a javascript program to ask or tell."

"But, lets not get caught up in a bunch of formal talk about computer "
"science and programming language theory, lets start with a simple example"
" of one of the things that Javascript is good at doing, namely making "
"buttons do interesting things.  For our first program lets make a button "
"that changes the background color of our window."

"The button tag is part of HTML that is going to allow us to make "
"interactive websites.  In addition to buttons there are other things like"
" check boxes, and text input, that we will talk about in the next "

"something we are all used to using every day."

"The ``onclick`` attribute is the way we answer the question, \"what "
"should this button do when someone clicks on it.\"  The answer in this "
"case is may lead to confusion, but hopefully you at least get the idea "
"that when the button is clicked we want to \"change this page\".  The way"
" we are going to do this is through a **function call**. You have used "
"functions in math class many times, and these are not all that different."
"  The important thing to remember is that functions are **abstractions** "
"of things that need doing.  We all use abstractions all the time in our "
"everyday life."

"That would be a long boring conversation if you responded with all 6 of "
"those steps every time a friend asked you what you were doing. But your "
"friend understands those steps are necessary when you say you are going "

"This brings us to the next question, the ``script`` tag is one way that "
"we can include Javascript in our HTML.  But like CSS we will see that we "

"The stuff inside the script tag is Javascript code. This code contains a "
"**function definition** which is how we create our very own abstractions."
" Unlike your friend to naturally understands what it means to go to "
"class, computers are very dumb, and very literal, they only do what you "
"tell them.  In this case there are two steps to our abstraction.  One "
"changes the background color of the body, and the second one changes our "
"message.  These lines are also abstractions of a very complicated set of "
