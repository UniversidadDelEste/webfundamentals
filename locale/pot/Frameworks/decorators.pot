msgid "One of the cool things about learning Python Frameworks is that you get to dig into some advanced Python features.  In our hello world example we mapped Python functions to URL's using Python decorators, Now its time to see how decorators work, and a simplified implementation of how Flask uses the concept to call a particular function based on a URL."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Frameworks/decorators.rst:6
msgid "Before we go there, lets look at a simpler example of a decorator to get an idea of how they work.  First lets start with a definition.  A decorator is a *callable* that takes a function as an argument and returns a replacement function."

msgid "Lets write a simple decorator that we can use so that a function can automatically keep track of the number of times it has been called.  This can sometimes be very useful for performance testing or debugging."

msgid "The ``call_counter`` function in the code below is a decorator, it takes a function as an argument, and returns a replacement function. The replacement function, called ``wrap``, is defined inside the ``call_counter`` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Frameworks/decorators.rst:12
msgid "First we define the wrap function which does two things.  First, it increments a counter attribute of itself, and then returns the result of calling ``func``, passing along any and all arguments.  *args allows you to define a function that accepts a variable number of parameters, and **kwargs allows you to have any number of named parameters.  This topic could be another whole chapter, but for now you can read a nice `concise description here. <http://markmiyashita.com/blog/python-args-and-kwargs/>`_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Frameworks/decorators.rst:14
msgid "You may be confused by the line ``wrap.counter += 1``.  But remember that in Python functions are objects like any other object.  We can always add attributes to objects by just using the dot notation and assigning.  Alternatively we could be really explicit about adding an attribute using ``setattr(wrap,'counter',0)``.  So all the wrap function does is add the ability to increment a private counter each time wrap is called, and then call the original function."

msgid "Here is the real key ``@call_counter`` notation before the  definition of fib, is the equivalent of adding the line``fib = call_counter(fib)`` after the function is defined.  You can comment out the ``@call_counter`` line and prove this to yourself."

In the definition of a decorator I used the term *callable*.  In Python callable means any object that understands the use of the () as call operators.  Huh?  Take a look at this example:"

It looks like we have used up our allotment of parameters with the string, where does the function go?"

In the first examples what came after the @ was the name of a function which simply evaluates to the function the name refers to.  In this case we evaluate an actual function call which happens to return a function.   during evaluation the argdec function is called passing the parameters 1,2,3.  The call to argdec computes a  value for ``a`` and defines wrap.  It then returns wrap.  Remember that nothing inside the wrap function is executed just yet.  Next the result of evaluating argdec(1,2,3) is called passing along the function we are decorating. which causes the ``wrapped_f`` function to be defined and returned."
