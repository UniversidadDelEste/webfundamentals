msgid "Let me begin with the statement that data modeling could be the most important skill you learn in your computer science career.  If you understand your (or your customer's) data, and can effectively communicate to your customer about their data you have already won half the battle.  Data modeling is an excellent communications tool, both to help you uncover hidden requirements and assumptions, and to facilitate good understanding between you and those you are working with."

msgid "Looking at our list, the first thing we may want to investigate is the course.  What is it about a course that uniquely identifies it?  What other things do we want to remember about a course.  At most colleges courses have unique identifiers that consist of the department and a number such as CS101 or BIO423.  For a course we may also want to remember the title of the course, the course description, how many credits the course is worth."

However, when you think about student you can probably think of many things ou wold want to remember about a student, so its no ordinary attribute.  In fact it is another entity."

However, how do we indicate that there is a relationship between a student and a course?  What kind of relationship?  There are three different relationships to consider:"

So we know that this relationship is at least a one to many relationship.  But now we need to ask the question from the other perspective. Does a student take just one course?  Probably not.  Does a student take many courses.  Yes.  So we have a many to many relationship.  This looks like the following figure:"

Inevitably, there is more that we want to remember about this relationship, or there is a name we want to assign to the relationship.  In this case the many to many relationship represents a student enrolling in a course.  So an enrollment is a new and important entity.  The enrollment represents a student taking a course.  Now there are things we want to remember about this occurrance.  When did the student take the course?  What grade did they receive?  What room was the course taught in?  Who taught the course?  With this in mind, we evolve or LDS to look like the following:"
