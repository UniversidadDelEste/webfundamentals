msgid "Hello World!  This book is/was written in the Fall of 2014 as I was teaching two courses on web programming.  One course was for potential and non CS majors who wanted to learn a little about web programming.  This course was seven weeks long and covered only Part 1.  The second course is a course I've taught for several years, without a book, that is for upper level CS students.  This course covers parts 1 and 2.  Part 1 can obviously be covered a lot faster for upper level CS students than it can for students with no programming background."

msgid "Because I've written it as I've been teaching the course, it only covers what I am able to accomplish in a semester, I realize you may differ with me on what is important.  The book is open source,  Fork it on github.  Submit an issue if you have feedback or suggestions for improvements. Submit a chapter if you have an idea for something you think is important that I have left out."
