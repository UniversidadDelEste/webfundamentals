msgid "In the previous example we have a name ``document`` as you may have guessed this document name refers to the entire HTML document (or page).  More technically, document is a name that refers to an **object**.  That object is the representation of the page."

msgid "Earlier we said that objects know things, and know how to do things, the terminology for the things that objects know is that objects have **attributes** attributes on objects serve the same purpose as attributes of tags, they contain some property of the object.   For example ``document.height`` tells us how many pixels high the entire page is.  Our example illustrates several other attributes:"

msgid "We can use these attributes in two ways.  First, we can use attributes to ask the object a question.  For example  ``document.body.style.backgroudColor`` could be interpreted as asking the document \"tell me your background color\". On the other hand  ``document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"lightblue\"`` should be interpreted as \"set your background color to lightblue\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Javascript/objects.rst:41
msgid "The key difference between the two interpretations in the preceeding paragraph is where the attribute is used in relationship to the equal sign. In fact the statement ``document.body.style.backgroundColor = \"lightblue\"`` is a special and very common programming statement called an **assignment statement**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Javascript/objects.rst:43
msgid "Now, you may also be wondering about the ``.`` between the various attributes in the statement.  You should read the dots between the attributes as:  document object (dot) return your body object (dot) return your style object (dot) return your backgroundColor object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Javascript/objects.rst:45
msgid "The innerHTML attribute allows us to change the html of any element in our document.  Of course as you noticed before changing the HTML value of the body wipes out all of the old tags and replaces it with whatever is in quotes.  Lets look at another example that illustrates another very important javascript function and will allow us to change only a small portion of the webpage."

msgid "Our function has grown!  But, don't let that worry you, we have added more assginment statemetnts that only change the ``main`` tag.  However we have introduced one very significant new programming feature into this example.  ``myMain`` is a **variable**.  Variables are names that we give to Javascript objects, in this case it is the ``main`` tag.  Now, given what you know so far, you might wonder why not just use ``document.body.main``?  Because it does not exist.  The document object has a ``body`` attribute because all documents have a ``body``, but not all documents have a ``main``."

msgstr ""

#: ../../_sources/Javascript/objects.rst:102
msgid "Now, the right hand side of the assignment statement contains a **method**. This is a fancy word for us telling an object to go do something for us.  In fact a method is just a fancy name for a function that is attached to an object, and so it is an abstraction too.  Now, here is the good news about this method.  Everything you learned about selectors in the previous chapter on CSS can be used to tell this method what you want it to find!   ``'main'`` is a parameter to the querySelector method, and could contain any selector we learned about in the previous chapter."

msgid "1.  Go back and modify the first example so that You can change the color of the h1. 1.  Change the HTML so that main has an id of ``\"a\"``.  Also add a second ``main`` tag that contains an h1.  The initial view of your page should not change.  What happens when you click the button? 2.   Now change the parameter to the querySelector method so that it finds main by its ID rather than by its tag?  What happens if you remove the id attribute from the first main and move it to the second?"
