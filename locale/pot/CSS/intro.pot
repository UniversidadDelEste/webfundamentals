msgid "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  Style sheets define how to display your html code.  This was not always the case.  In HTML 3 the designers of the language added tags like font and color. This was great for companies like Microsoft where you could export your word doc as html, but created a nightmare for developers of large sites that were not developed using WYSIWYG tools, and it made the html completely unreadable.  So, in HTML 4.0 CSS was introduced to fix the problem we created for ourselves."

msgid "CSS defines how the html should look, and it does this using a set of rules.  We are all used to following certain rules in every day life:  **If** it is raining, **then** take your umbrella.  **If** the light is red, **then** come to a stop at the stoplight.  In html terms we might say, **if** the tag is an ``h1`` **then** color it blue and set the font size to 28 points."

msgid "You can put all of your CSS in a separate style file and include the style file into your HTML.  This is the preferred way of doing it because it achieves the greatest amount of separation between the content and how the content looks."

msgid "There are several things to notice about the example above.  First the ``h1`` selector matches all of the h1 tags in the document.  But it does not match the ``h2`` or the ``p`` tags.  If you want to change the style of the paragraph you need to add another rule.  Lets try it:  Add a rule to the style tag that colors the paragraph text green.  Then make another rule that makes the h2 tag size 16pt and yellow."

msgid "One thing to be careful about is to remember the semi-colons after the values.  If you forget a semi-colon, then your rule will not work."

msgid "Using a separate css file is the most preferred way to organize your CSS.  This allows you to use the same style in multiple web pages, and in a group setting makes it easy for one person to work on the style while another focuses on the content.  CSS stylesheets are included in a web page by using the ``link`` tag in the ``head`` section of your page as follows:"

If there is a conflict then then internal style tag wins.  These rules are then combined with any style information contained in a style attribute.  If the style attribute conflicts with any previous informatin, it wins."
