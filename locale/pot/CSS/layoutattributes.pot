msgid "Before we go any further it is important to stop and think a bit about how the browser renders the html into the browser window.  As the browser reads each html tag, it must figure out where on the page it belongs.  For the most part, the browser flows each tag from top to bottom and from left to right.  As we have mentioned block elements start on a new line, and inline elements flow from left to right, fitting within the horizontal size of the page or else going on to the next line.  In this section we will consider several different CSS options that have an impact on the layout of a page."
