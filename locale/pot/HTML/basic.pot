msgid "As you might expect, the headings continue to get smaller as you go from 1 to 6.  But when you go to level 7 the text gets bigger.  This is because the web browser is written so that it just ignores any tags that it does not know about.  This is somewhat of a disadvantage as you don't get any error messages, things just look wrong, and you have to figure out why."

msgid "Another aspect of the heading tag is that it is what we call a **block** tag.  Notice that each heading appears on its own line.  Thats pretty much what we would expect for a heading.  But not necessarily for other tags.  shortly, we will see some **inline** tags that do not each appear on their own line."

In fact the last sentence of the previous section used a link to send you to the w3schools website to learn more about the attributes of an ``img`` tag.  Links are what made the web so popular in the first place.  Today we call them links, but in earlier years they were usually referred to as Hyperlinks. You can provide a link to any URL on the web using the ``href`` attribute on the ``a`` tag.   The text that you will click on goes between the opening ``a`` tag and the closing ``a`` tag."
