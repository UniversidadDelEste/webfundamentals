msgid "Before Javascript, the only way to make your web application interactive and dynamic was to use forms and have a program that worked with your web server generate HTML on the fly.  This is one of the most important ideas in web programming.  We don't have to limit our thinking about a web server returning the contents of a static file.  It is all just text after all, so it does not have to come from a file, it could just as well be generated by a bunch of print statements in a program."

msgid "In fact that will be our starting point.  All the other web development work since the mid 1990's has been to improve upon the idea that a web page can be generated from some print statements."

msgid "Now the next question is to ask how does this happen?  How can I get this hello program to generate code and serve my own browser?  The first thing you need to do is create a folder called ``www``.  In the ``www`` folder make a second folder called ``cgi-bin`` and place create a ``hello.py`` file in that folder."

msgid "When the web server sees a URL that is in the cgi-bin folder it knows that instead of just returning the contents of the file, it should execute the program and direct the output from that program back to the browser.  Cool right?!"
